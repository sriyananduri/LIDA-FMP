A Streamlit app that fetches 5-minute historical stock data for a given company (using the company symbol), generates goals using LIDA's text generation capabilities through gpt-4o-mini, and visualizes the data based on a selected goal. The app also provides an option to enter a custom goal and generates a visualization accordingly. A detailed explanation of the visualization is also given underneath the visualization.

Deployed at https://lida-fmp.streamlit.app/ using streamlit community cloud.
